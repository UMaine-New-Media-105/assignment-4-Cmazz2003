Challenge 1 - We were instructed to use a loop to build a radially symmetric shape. I ended up choosing a flower or what looks to be a flower if you think about it real hard. The loop was packaged inside a custom function so I could pass parameters that set all aspects of the shape. I then used the function to create multiple shapes on the canvas. https://editor.p5js.org/CMazz/sketches/1-lf9OWvJ
