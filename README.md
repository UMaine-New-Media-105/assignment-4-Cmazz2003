Challenge 1 - I used a loop to build a radially symmetric shape. I ended up choosing a flower or what looks to be a flower if you think about it real hard. The loop was packaged inside a custom function so I could pass parameters that set all aspects of the shape. I then used the function to create multiple shapes on the canvas. https://editor.p5js.org/CMazz/sketches/1-lf9OWvJ

Challenge 2 - I repeated my combination of flower shapes horizontally and vertically to create a two-dimensional pattern. I did this by addingg loops into the draw function to repeat the tile of shapes I had already created https://editor.p5js.org/CMazz/sketches/SWUt_0H7v

Challenge 3 - I incorporated randomness into the parameters of my choosing in the 2-D design I made previously with my flower shape. https://editor.p5js.org/CMazz/sketches/W65dgZKkM

Challenge 4 - I created a pattern with what looks like a solar eclipse sprite in a set order showing off the different phases of an eclipse. https://editor.p5js.org/CMazz/sketches/eCf8_ppUH
